## Nostalgia


Remember the good old days? Let me jog your memory.


> Nostalgia is the sentimental yearning for the happiness of a former time or place,

> Nostalgia privileges memory and perception over reality, and favors a utopian and imagined past over the real one.

> The psychological phenomenon of nostalgia is triggered physiologically from sights, sounds, smells, and tastes.

>Nostalgia can stimulate a wistful desire for an era before your lifetime that in our collective imagination—from photos, television, and films—is one we perceive as being simpler.

>On a basic level, recalling these positive memories simply puts us in a more positive mood. On a more complex level, recalling these experiences makes us feel a stronger sense of social connectedness with others.”

> "hypochondria of the heart."

>Equally human is our need to mark time: so we keep calendars and agendas and diaries and albums, all of them gestures of physicality and permanence, tangible, graphic reminders of our own evolution, participation and engagement with the world around us. 

> Memory is a history that, more often than not, depends on the collective stronghold of a series of highly individualized stories.
