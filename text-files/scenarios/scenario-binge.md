## Scenario Binge

**User Story**

As a binge watcher, I Want to watch all the Christmas episodes of the office easily, without having to hunt and pick for each episode in a season.

Watch time: 3hr+

##### Whats Frustrating:
- Not all seasons have a Christmas episode
- Current UX doesn't have definitions for this, not tagging for types
- Cannot binge, have to search for episodes after each one.
