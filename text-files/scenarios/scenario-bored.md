## Scenario Bored

**User Story**

As a returning bored user, I want a collection of episodes that provides variety to my lineup that doesn't require thr full attention of a film.

Watch time: >90mins

Planning to watch something just not the length of a feature film. Will probably being doing something in the background. (Like paying on phone or working on the computer)

##### Whats Frustrating:
- No clue what to watch.
- Want varitery within TV shows.
