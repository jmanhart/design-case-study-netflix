## Option 01 (In your face)

### 25 Days of Christmas Advent Calendar Option.
Having just a bunch of different options at you disposale without any context feels very cold. Adding in an element of fun and structure seems more in the nature of the celebration. Christmas already has a whole 25 days of tradition tieing back to the advent calendar. Adding in a checklist approach to keep you watching every night. You can spice in movies as to break up the days.

The list can be populated by what is popular and highest rated by users and also work off of your personal tastes. The list would need to be adaptive to missing days or wanting to skip ahead, and account for all edge cases. Like benge watching. 

## Option 02 Integrated Side Scroll component
A less invasive option would be for people that `watch & repeat` series. Example: My wife and I always have a running pass going of The Office. Those users will get prompted a `side-scrolling` list of options for holiday episodes for that series. This option could ranger from 2 episodes _(Seinfeld)_ â€“ 7 episodes _(The Office)_. There would be quite a few edge cases for this option




Netflix has countless movies and TV shows available for streaming with many different catagories that are tailor made for your personal preferences. One of the categories the service uses relates to what holiday is coming up next on the calendar. (Christmas Movies, Halloween Movies, Valentines Day Movies). Netflix also has hundreds of different TV shows available for streaming all of which have designated holiday episodes. These episodes are usually spread across multiple different seasons.

### What I want to create:
A stand alone section in the Netflix ecosystem that highlights the different Holiday themed TV episodes in one place. Usually a Christmas TV episode is a standalone episode and doesn't relay on a great narrative.
