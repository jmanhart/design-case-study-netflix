# Design Case Study Netflix

Netflix has countless movies and TV shows available for streaming with many different catagories that are tailor made for your personal preferences. One of the categories the service uses relates to what holiday is coming up next on the calendar. (Christmas Movies, Halloween Movies, Valentines Day Movies). Netflix also has hundreds of different TV shows available for streaming all of which have designated holiday episodes. These episodes are usually spread across multiple different seasons.

### What I want to create:
A stand alone section in the Netflix ecosystem that highlights the different Holiday themed TV episodes in one place. Usually a Christmas TV episode is a standalone episode and doesn't relay on a great narrative.

## Research 
Culling of the data for the most famous (American) TV series that have holiday episodes and documenting them. Given that there is hundreds of different TV shows out there I decided to focus on these ten series and only highlight Christmas episodes.

1. The Office
2. Frasier 
3. Simpsons
4. Friends
5. The Big Bang Theory
6. How I met your Mother
7. Seinfeld
8. Community
9. Fresh Prince
10. 30 Rock
